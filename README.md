# RNN and Reinforcement Learning

This project explores the integration of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to model sequential decision-making tasks. RNNs are used to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, while RL provides a framework for learning optimal actions based on rewards over time.

## Project Overview

The notebook covers the following:

- Introduction to RNNs and their application to temporal sequences
- Basics of Reinforcement Learning and environment interaction
- Building and training an RNN model in an RL setting
- Monitoring the agent's performance over time
- Visualizing rewards and behavior

## Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your implementation)
- OpenAI Gym (if environment simulation is used)
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Features

- Implementation of RNNs for stateful decision making
- Integration with an RL environment for agent training
- Visualization of cumulative rewards and training progress
- Simple, modular structure for experimentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required dependencies:

pip install numpy matplotlib gym tensorflow


(Replace `tensorflow` with `torch` if using PyTorch.)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rnn-rl.git


2. Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook rnn_rl.ipynb


3. Follow the notebook instructions to train and evaluate your RNN-based agent.

## Customization

You can modify this project to:

- Use different types of RNNs (e.g., LSTM, GRU)
- Apply the model to custom or more complex environments
- Compare RNN-based agents with feedforward models
- Integrate reward shaping or exploration strategies
